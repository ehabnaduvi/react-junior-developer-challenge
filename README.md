### Demo :rocket: https://unsplahnaduvi.netlify.app/

```

This is a coding challenge for prospective front-end developer applicants. If you're unfamiliar with React, Facebook has put together a helpful tutorial that provides a quick introduction to the basics: https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html

## Goal:

#### Build a simple React app that allows viewing and interacting (zooming, opening in a dialog, any other prefered animation / action) with a grid of curated photos from Unsplash.

- [ ] Fork this repository or create a new public repo into your Github account. If you do not have one, you can a free account as shown here: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account
- [ ] Create a new working branch to work on.
- [ ] Use `create-react-app` to set up a basic single-page React application as shown here: https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app. (NOTE: We will only focus on creating a single-page React application, so don't worry about the other sections on that page such as Next.js).
- [ ] Refer to the Unsplash API docs here to set up a developer account: https://unsplash.com/documentation.
- [ ] Display a grid of photos in your React app. Use the `GET /photos/random` endpoint from the Unsplash API to get a set of images.
- [ ] The grid of photos should preserve the aspect ratio of the photos it's displaying, meaning it shouldn't crop the image in any way.
- [ ] The grid should be responsive, and should work in both portrait and landscape orientations on both mobile and desktop browsers.
- [ ] You're free to use existing open source React components or Javascript packages/libraries from npm to complete this task.
- [ ] Once you are ready to share your code, please inform us of the repo and branch

### Evaluation:
- [ ] The React app should build without errors (typically using `npm run build`). If there are necessary steps required to get it to compile, those should be covered in README.md.
- [ ] No crashes or bugs.
- [ ] App should operate as a single-page application, without the need for a custom back-end.
- [ ] Code is easily understood and communicative (eg. comments, variable names, etc).
- [ ] GitHub commit history is consistent, easy to follow and understandable.
